# pos-supervisor — system architecture

A walkthrough of how the validator turns a `validate_code` call into a
diagnostic with hints and proposed fixes, what every data file under
`src/data/` actually does, what the dashboard's vocabulary
(`unmatched`, `active`, `adoption`, `collateral`) actually measures, and
how the adaptive engine and CAC predictor read analytics back into the
emit path.

The document is meant to make the system legible end-to-end: after
reading it you should be able to look at a row in the dashboard and
trace it backwards to a concrete file you can edit.

---

## 0. Reading guide for the report you generated

The numbers from `pos-supervisor-report-2026-05-01_18-31-50.md` line up
with the concepts below, so a quick orientation:

- **Funnel: 357 emitted → 254 resolved (71%), 23 regressed (6%).**
  254/357 windows were resolved across 71 sessions. That's "we said
  something useful 7 times out of 10". 6% regression rate is low but
  not zero — the agents took our fix and broke something else in 23
  cases. Anything tagged `HARMFUL` in the rule table contributed to
  those 23.
- **Health score 15/100 (infrastructure only).** That's not "the
  validator is broken" — it's "the dashboard's project-analysis tab was
  never run on this DEMO project, so the project-shape dimensions stay
  zero". Click "Analyze Project" once and the score takes its real
  value.
- **`PartialCallArguments`: 80 emits, 87% resolved, 10% regressed,
  GOOD.** This is the workhorse — it fires the most and the agent
  almost always gets it right. The fact that
  `PartialCallArguments.unmatched` accounts for 49 of those 80 is the
  interesting part: the rule engine doesn't have a specific
  rule_id for ~60% of these emits, just the catch-all (see §4.4 below).
  Adding a few `PartialCallArguments.<variant>` rules would be a real
  effectiveness win.
- **`MissingPage`: 14 emits, 25% resolved, LOW.** Most of those
  14 are the self-page false positive we just fixed (Issue 4).
  Resolution rate should climb on the next run.
- **`NonGetRenderingPage.get_form_target`: 1 emit, 100% regressed,
  -100% effectiveness, INSUFFICIENT_DATA.** Don't act on this row yet —
  one regression on one emit is not enough signal. The
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` label is doing exactly what it should: blocking
  panic.
- **`UNMATCHED` rule_ids dominating the bottom of the rule table.**
  Every row labelled `UNMATCHED` is "the LSP fired this check, no rule
  modulematched, so we tagged the diagnostic with `<check>.unmatched`
  and emitted it raw". Each one is a candidate for a new rule — the
  bigger `Emitted` column the more impact a rule would have. The CLAUDE.md
  prompt for adding a rule lives in §4 below.
- **Knowledge gaps section says 100% coverage on every check.**
  "Coverage" here means "does a rule module exist for this check name",
  not "does a rule fire on every diagnostic". The two are different —
  a check can have a rule module that only handles 1 of 10 sub-cases,
  leaving 9 as `.unmatched`. Use the rule-performance table for the
  finer-grained view.

The rest of this document explains why each of those bullets is true.

## 1. The big picture in three boxes

```
┌──────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────────────┐    ┌────────┐
│  Agent   │ →  │  validate_code (one tool call)  │ →  │ Agent  │
└──────────┘    │                                 │    └────────┘
                │  1. parse → AST                 │

                │  3. enrich → hint, fix, conf.   │
                │  4. pipeline → suppress/verify  │
                │  5. CAC gate (optional)         │
                │  6. shape response, log emit    │
                └─────────────────────────────────┘
                                │
                                ▼
                ┌────────────────────────────────┐
                │  Analytics (closed loop)       │
                │  validator_emit → SQLite       │
                │  next call → window classifier │
                │  → outcomes → case base        │
                │  → engine state (next emit)    │
                └────────────────────────────────┘
```

Three things are happening at once:

1. **Synchronous** — the agent's `validate_code` call walks a fixed
   pipeline and gets back errors, warnings, fixes, and a
   `must_fix_before_write` boolean.
2. **Persistent** — every emit is appended to
   `.pos-supervisor/sessions/<id>/events.ndjson`, then ingested into
   `analytics.db` (SQLite) for analysis.
3. **Reflective** — the next time the same diagnostic fires, the
   engine reads the analytics and adjusts: lower confidence, suppress,
   downgrade severity, or auto-disable the rule.

Boxes (2) and (3) are the "neuro" half of the
neuro-symbolic split that the codebase calls the **adaptive engine**
(see §6).

## 2. Vocabulary you must internalise first

Mixing these up is the main reason the dashboard feels confusing.

| Term            | What it actually is                                                                 | Lives in                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **check**       | The name of an issue category emitted by the LSP / pos-cli check / our structural checks. Examples: `MissingPartial`, `LiquidHTMLSyntaxError`, `pos-supervisor:HtmlInPage`. The LSP picks it. | LSP / structural-warnings.js              |
| **diagnostic**  | One concrete instance of a check at a (file, line, column) with a message.          | the LSP / our pipeline                    |
| **rule**        | A piece of code (`src/core/rules/<Check>.js`) that turns a raw diagnostic into a richer one with a hint, suggested fix, and confidence number. Each check has 0..N rules; the engine picks one (first-match-wins, by priority). | rules/                                    |
| **rule_id**     | The id the rule stamps onto the diagnostic — `MissingPartial.invalid_lib_prefix`. The dashboard groups by this. | set by `apply()` of the rule              |
| **`<check>.unmatched`** | A synthetic rule_id we stamp when no rule matched, so analytics bucket every emit. Tells you: "this check fired and our rule library had nothing to say". | populated in `populateDefaultConfidence()` in diagnostic-pipeline.js |
| **hint**        | A markdown blob that explains the issue to the agent. Either inline (from the rule's `apply()`) or rendered from a template under `src/data/hints/<Check>.md`. | hints/ + rules                            |
| **fix**         | A structured proposal — `text_edit`, `insert`, `create_file`, or `guidance`. Generated by `fix-generator.js` for a fixed set of checks; rules can also return their own. | fix-generator.js + rules                  |
| **outcome**     | What happened between two consecutive `validate_code` calls on the same file: `resolved`, `regressed`, `unchanged`, `moved`. Computed by the **window classifier**. | window-classifier.js                       |
| **fix_applied** | One of `verbatim`, `partial`, `ignored`, computed by comparing the file before/after the edit against any proposed fixes. | window-classifier.js → analytics-store.js |
| **window**      | A pair of consecutive validate_code calls on the same (session, file). The unit of measurement. | window-classifier.js                       |
| **window_id**   | Primary key of a `windows` row.                                                     | analytics-store.js                        |
| **fp** / **template_fp** | Stable hashes — `fp = hash(check, file, message_template)`, `template_fp = hash(check, message_template)`. `fp` lets us track the same diagnostic across calls; `template_fp` groups variants of the same template. | diagnostic-record.js                      |
| **collateral**  | When a fix is applied and the diagnostic resolves, but a NEW diagnostic appears at the same time — the agent broke something else. `collateral_added` = max(0, regressed - resolved) within the same window. | window-classifier.js                       |
| **active rule** | A rule that is currently being run on incoming diagnostics. Same set as `_registry minus _disabledRules`. | engine.js                                 |
| **adoption rate** | Of the windows where a fix was proposed for a diagnostic, how many ended with `fix_applied = 'verbatim'`. Per rule_id. | case-base.js                              |
| **resolution rate** | Of the windows where a diagnostic with this rule_id was emitted, how many ended with `outcome = 'resolved'`. | case-base.js / analytics-queries.js       |
| **regression rate** | Of the same population, how many ended with `outcome = 'regressed'` (the diagnostic came back at a different fp). | case-base.js / analytics-queries.js       |
| **effectiveness** | `resolution_rate - regression_rate`. The headline number on the dashboard. | analytics-labels.js                       |

Internalise that list and the rest reads itself.

## 3. The synchronous request lifecycle

This is what happens during one `validate_code` call. The actual code
lives in `src/tools/validate-code.js` and `src/core/diagnostic-pipeline.js`.

### 3.1 Step 1 — parse

```
content (string)
  └─→ parseLiquidFile(content)            # @platformos/liquid-html-parser
        └─→ extractAllFromAST(ast)        # slug, layout, method, renders,
                                          # graphql, filters, tags, doc_params, …
```

We parse with the platformOS Liquid parser in **tolerant** mode, walk
the AST once with `liquid-parser.js:walk`, and produce a
`structural` object that downstream steps read. This is the "ground
truth" view of what the file actually does — slugs, methods, doc params,
referenced partials, translations.

If the parse fails entirely, we still continue: the linter step often
catches the underlying syntax error and we want the agent to see *that*
error, not a cascade of "could not parse" infos.

### 3.2 Step 2 — lint (raw diagnostics)

Two upstream sources, picked at runtime:

- **LSP path** (default when `pos-cli lsp` is up). We forward
  `textDocument/didOpen` with the in-memory content, await
  `publishDiagnostics`, normalise into our internal diagnostic shape
  (`{ check, severity, message, line, column, endLine, endColumn,
   _filePath }`).
- **check-runner fallback** (`pos-cli check run` subprocess). Used
  when the LSP isn't running or crashed. Same diagnostic shape after
  `parseCheckResult`.

This step is the *only* place where check names enter the system. The
universe of check names is defined upstream by `pos-cli`, plus our own
`pos-supervisor:*` namespace from `structural-warnings.js`.

### 3.3 Step 3 — enrich (rule engine + per-check fallbacks)

Run inside `error-enricher.js:enrichAll`. For every diagnostic:

1. **LSP hover** at the diagnostic position is attached as
   `hover_docs`. Cached per (line, column) so duplicates are cheap.
2. **Rule engine** (`runRules(diag, facts)`):
   - The rule registry is keyed by check name. For
     `MissingPartial`, it loads everything in
     `src/core/rules/MissingPartial.js` (priority 5, 10, 20, 30, 40)
     plus any **promoted rules** from
     `.pos-supervisor/promoted-rules.json` (see §6.4) and any
     `_disabledRules` are skipped.
   - First rule whose `when(diag, facts)` returns truthy wins. Its
     `apply(diag, facts)` returns `{ rule_id, hint_md, fixes,
     confidence, see_also?, case_base_signal? }`.
   - The result is folded into the diagnostic. If the check has rules
     and a rule matched, we *skip* the per-check regex enrichment that
     follows; the rule is authoritative.
3. **Per-check regex enrichment fallback** (the older code path
   that still handles ~half the checks). For checks like
   `UnknownFilter`, `UndefinedObject`, `MetadataParamsCheck` etc., we
   parse the raw LSP message with regexes, look up the symbol in our
   indexes (`filtersIndex`, `objectsIndex`, `tagsIndex`,
   `schemaIndex`), and produce a hint by rendering the appropriate
   template under `src/data/hints/<Check>.md` with the extracted
   variables. Shopify contamination detection happens here too —
   `isShopifyObject` / `isShopifyFilter` against
   `src/data/knowledge.json` (and the dedicated
   `shopify-objects.json` / `shopify-contamination.json`).
4. **Pinned see-also** — `attachSeeAlso` looks up the diagnostic in
   `src/data/checks/<Check>.yml` for a curated "see also" link to
   another tool (e.g. `domain_guide(commands, api)`).

After this step every diagnostic has a `hint`, possibly a
`suggestion`, a `rule_id` (or no rule_id yet — that gets stamped later
in step 5), a `confidence` (or null), and possibly `fixes`.

### 3.4 Step 4 — diagnostic post-processing pipeline

`runDiagnosticPipeline()` in `src/core/diagnostic-pipeline.js`. This is
where we suppress, downgrade, or annotate diagnostics that are
known-false-positive for platformOS-specific reasons. Each step is a
pure function over the result; the order is documented in the
ORDERING CONTRACT comment at the top of the file.

The current pipeline (post our most recent fix) is:

```
0.   userSuppressions                    # .pos-supervisor-ignore.yml
0a.  suppressLspKnownFalsePositives      # NEW: assign x = a == b regression
1.   suppressDocParams                   # @param X declared → no UndefinedObject(X)
2.   suppressUnusedDocParams             # X used as named arg → not "unused"
3.   elevateShopify                      # Shopify-* warnings → errors
4.   deduplicateArgChecks                # MissingRender* covers MetadataParams*
5.   suppressUndocumentedTargetParams    # MetadataParamsCheck on undocumented partial
6.   suppressRequiredParamsWithDefault   # | default:'' in target → "required" is wrong
7.   suppressModuleHelpers               # DeprecatedTag on module/* includes
8.   suppressOrphanedPartial             # commands/queries are invoked dynamically
9.   suppressByPending (files)           # MissingPartial for in-plan files
10.  suppressByPending (pages)           # MissingPage for in-plan pages
11.  suppressByPending (translations)    # TranslationKeyExists for in-plan keys
12.  verifyMissingAssets                 # disk scan vs LSP cache
13.  verifyTranslationKeysOnDisk         # disk scan vs LSP cache
14.  verifyPageRoutesOnDisk              # NEW: also folds in in-memory overlay
15.  verifyOrphanedPartialOnDisk         # disk scan finds callers
16.  verifyMissingPartialsOnDisk         # disk scan vs LSP cache
17.  populateDefaultConfidence           # stamp <check>.unmatched + default conf
```

Each step emits at most one `pos-supervisor:*Suppressed` info
diagnostic so the agent sees a single audit line per kind of
suppression instead of being silently denied.

The ORDERING CONTRACT exists because some steps depend on others
having run already (e.g. the disk-verification steps run *after* the
in-plan suppression so an in-plan file isn't double-counted).

### 3.5 Step 5 — fix generation

For full mode, `fix-generator.js:generateFixes` walks the surviving
diagnostics and tries to attach a concrete `proposed_fixes` array.
Four fix kinds:

- **`text_edit`** — exact range replacement. Used for variable
  renames, filter renames, slug normalisation, etc.
- **`insert`** — insert text at a position. Used for `{% doc %}`
  blocks, frontmatter additions.
- **`create_file`** — create a missing file. Used for
  `MissingPartial` / `MissingAsset` when the path is unambiguous.
- **`guidance`** — description only, no machine-applicable edit. Used
  when the right answer requires reasoning the linter can't do.

A "scorecard" is also computed in full mode — a small array of
`{ category, status, reason }` rows showing how the file scores against
architectural concerns (e.g. doc-block coverage, layout
correctness). It's displayed in the agent's response and also stored
for later analysis.

### 3.6 Step 6 — CAC predictor (optional gate)

`cac-predictor.js:applyCac` runs over the surviving diagnostics if the
operator has enabled it (state lives in
`.pos-supervisor/cac-config.json`). For each surviving diagnostic it
predicts the probability the agent will adopt the fix, then either
allows, downgrades severity, or suppresses. Detail in §6.5.

If CAC is in `shadow` mode, decisions are *recorded* but the result is
not mutated — used to pre-flight a threshold change before flipping to
`active`.

### 3.7 Step 7 — shape the response, log the emit

The final response includes:

- `errors`, `warnings`, `infos` — the surviving diagnostics with all
  the enrichment fields populated.
- `proposed_fixes` — the fix-generator output.
- `clusters` — diagnostics grouped by root-cause heuristic.
- `scorecard` — the architectural scorecard.
- `tips`, `domain_guide` — for full mode only.
- `structural` — what we extracted from the AST.
- `_pipelineTrace` — what each pipeline step removed (for the
  dashboard's "Pipeline inspector" tab).
- `status` — `'ok' | 'warning' | 'error'`.
- `must_fix_before_write` — boolean. The single most important field
  for the agent. If true, the agent is forbidden from writing the
  file. Set whenever there's at least one error OR a "blocking
  warning" survives (`OrphanedPartial`, `pos-supervisor:RemovedRender`,
  etc. — the list is at the top of `validate-code.js`).
- `next_step` — a deterministic prose paragraph telling the agent what
  to do next.

Finally we emit per-diagnostic `validator_emit` events to the session
event log and a single `tool_call` event for the whole call. Both go to
`.pos-supervisor/sessions/<id>/events.ndjson`.

---

## 4. The data files and their roles

`src/data/` is a small read-mostly knowledge base that backs both the
synchronous validation path and the `lookup` / `domain_guide` /
`module_info` tools. Each file has a tightly defined role; mixing them
up is the main reason hints sometimes feel out of place.

### 4.1 `src/core/rules/<Check>.js` — the rules

What the registry calls a "rule". One JS file per check, each
exporting `rules: Rule[]` that gets loaded via
`src/core/rules/index.js:loadAllRules`.

**A rule object:**

```js
{
  id:       'MissingPartial.invalid_lib_prefix',
  check:    'MissingPartial',
  priority: 5,                              // lower = matched first
  when:     (diag, facts) => boolean,       // gate predicate
  apply:    (diag, facts) => ({
    rule_id:    'MissingPartial.invalid_lib_prefix',
    hint_md:    '...markdown...',
    fixes:      [{ type: 'text_edit', ... }],
    confidence: 0.95,                        // 0..1
    see_also:   { tool, args, reason },     // optional
  }),
}
```

The priority order is the load-bearing detail. The first rule whose
`when` returns truthy wins. So `MissingPartial.invalid_lib_prefix`
(priority 5) runs *before* `MissingPartial.module_path` (priority 10)
and `MissingPartial.suggest_nearest` (priority 30) — by the time
"suggest a nearest match" runs we know the path doesn't have the
known-bad `lib/` prefix.

### 4.2 `src/data/hints/<Check>.md` — hint templates

A markdown file rendered by `hint-loader.js:getHint`. Supports
`{{var}}` substitution. Used by the **per-check regex enrichment
fallback** path — i.e. the older code path that runs when no rule is
registered, or as a default when a rule doesn't include `hint_md`.

Two categories of hints exist:

- **Generic** — `MissingPartial.md`. Used as the default for the check.
- **Specialised** — `MissingPartial-invalid_lib_prefix.md`,
  `MissingPartial-module.md`. Picked by the regex enrichment path
  based on params extracted from the message.

A hint can also live inline in a rule's `apply()` (the `hint_md`
field). When both exist, the rule's `hint_md` wins. As we migrate more
checks into the rule engine, the hints/ folder becomes the fallback,
not the primary surface.

### 4.3 `src/data/checks/<Check>.yml` — check metadata

A small YAML descriptor per check:

```yaml
name: MissingPartial
summary: Referenced partial/command/query file does not exist
hint:
  default: 'Create the missing file. Partials: …'
```

Used by:

- `domain_guide` and `lookup` tools — they show the `summary` and
  `hint.default` to give agents quick orientation.
- The rule-engine fallback when a rule doesn't supply `hint_md`.
- The dashboard's check inventory tab.

This is the "TL;DR" surface for each check. The hints/ template is
where the long-form fix steps live.

### 4.4 `src/data/knowledge.json` — pinned domain facts

Most general-purpose data the validator needs. Top keys:

- `version`
- `checks` — pinned per-check "summary" + "hint" objects + Shopify
  contamination lists. This is consumed by `knowledge-loader.js`.
- `language_features` — same content as `language-features.yml`,
  inlined for fast lookup. (See §4.7.)
- `domains` — per-domain rules and triggered gotchas (see `domain-gotchas.yml`).
- `content_triggers` — pattern → guidance (see `content-triggers.yml`).
- `modules_missing_docs` — list of module helpers known to ship without
  `{% doc %}` blocks; the suppressUndocumentedTargetParams pipeline
  step trusts this list.

Edits here propagate everywhere: a new entry in `checks.UnknownFilter.shopify_filters` immediately changes how `error-enricher.js` classifies an `UnknownFilter` for `money_with_currency`.

### 4.5 `src/data/content-triggers.yml` — pattern advisories

A list of `{ id, pattern, message, severity, domains }` rules. Patterns
are regexes; when the file's *content* matches, the validator emits a
"tip" (advisory info diagnostic) in the response. Used for things that
don't fit the LSP's check vocabulary:

```yaml
- id: raw_filter_xss
  pattern: \|\s*raw\s*[%}]
  message: 'XSS risk: | raw disables HTML escaping…'
  severity: security
  domains: [pages, partials, layouts]
```

The triggering happens in `getContentTriggers()` (called from
`validate-code.js`). These are *not* errors and do *not* contribute to
`must_fix_before_write` — they're shown under `tips:` in the response.

### 4.6 `src/data/domain-gotchas.yml` — domain-aware reminders

Domain-specific advisories keyed by the file's domain (which we infer
from path via `domain-detector.js`):

```yaml
pages:
  rule: 'Pages are controllers — logic only, no inline HTML…'
  gotchas:
    - id: pages_context_prefix
      trigger: has_check:UndefinedObject
      message: 'Use context.params, context.session, …'
      severity: required
```

`trigger` decides when the gotcha fires. Three forms:

- `always` — every validation in this domain.
- `has_check:<Check>` — only when the diagnostic list contains that
  check.
- `uses_tag:<tag>` — only when the file uses that tag (e.g. `try`).

`getTriggeredGotchas` returns the matching ones; they end up in
`domain_guide` (in full mode) and in the `domain_guide` tool's output.

### 4.7 `src/data/language-features.yml` — Liquid feature reference

Authoritative reference for platformOS-specific Liquid extensions:
`try_catch`, `theme_render_rc`, `liquid_doc`, hash literals, array
literals, etc. Used by `lookup` and the agent-facing domain guide. The
contents are also mirrored under `knowledge.json:language_features` so
runtime lookups are JSON-backed.

If you add a new Liquid feature, write the entry here, regenerate
`knowledge.json` from this file, and the rest of the system picks it
up.

### 4.8 `src/data/modules-missing-docs.json` — known undocumented helpers

A flat list of paths under `modules/*` that the validator should treat
as "undocumented partial" without disk verification:

```json
{
  "modules": [
    "modules/core/commands/execute",
    "modules/admin-ui/views/partials/header",
    ...
  ]
}
```

The pipeline step `suppressUndocumentedTargetParams` reads this and
suppresses `MetadataParamsCheck` for any function/render call into
those paths (since the LSP would otherwise flag every required-param
case based on inferred-from-usage params, all of them false
positives).

This file is the safety hatch for "the upstream module doesn't ship a
`{% doc %}` and we can't change the upstream module".

### 4.9 `src/data/domains/<domain>.md` and `references/`

Long-form documentation served by the `domain_guide` and `lookup` tools.
Not consumed by the validator's emit path — these are agent reading
material. `domains/commands.md`, `domains/pages.md`, etc. are the
canonical source for "how do you write a command, the platformOS way".

### 4.10 `src/data/shopify-objects.json`, `shopify-contamination.json`

Pinned lists of Shopify-only identifiers (objects, filters, tags) that
should never appear in platformOS code. Consumed by `knowledge-loader.js`
and `error-enricher.js` to elevate `UndefinedObject('product')` from
"variable not found" to "Shopify contamination — platformOS doesn't
have this object". The "elevateShopify" pipeline step turns those
warnings into errors.

### 4.11 `src/data/resources/`

Read once at server startup and exposed as MCP resources. Currently:
`platformos-synthesis.md`, the agent's session-startup primer.

## 5. What the dashboard words mean

The dashboard (`/dashboard.html`, served from `src/dashboard.js` over
HTTP from `src/http-server.js`) summarises the analytics SQLite
database, so its terms are the analytics vocabulary plus a few labels.

### 5.1 Outcomes (per diagnostic, per window)

`window-classifier.js` takes two consecutive `validate_code` calls on
the same file and labels each diagnostic from the *first* call with
one of four outcomes:

| Outcome      | Meaning                                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resolved`   | The diagnostic's `fp` was present in the start call, absent in the end call. The agent fixed it. |
| `regressed`  | A `fp` *not* in the start call appears in the end call. New diagnostic introduced. |
| `unchanged`  | Same `fp` present in both start and end. The agent didn't fix it.      |
| `moved`      | The `template_fp` is present in both, but the `fp` changed. Same root cause, different line — usually because the agent edited surrounding code and the diagnostic shifted. |

A fifth, `write_unverified`, exists for windows where we never saw a
follow-up call (the agent gave up or moved on).

### 5.2 fix_applied (per outcome)

For non-regressed outcomes, we compare the file's content range against
any `proposed_fixes` we emitted:

| Value      | Meaning                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `verbatim` | The agent applied the proposed fix exactly. This is the strongest "they listened to us" signal. |
| `partial`  | The fix range was modified, but not exactly as proposed.                |
| `ignored`  | The content in the fix range is unchanged (yet the diagnostic resolved or regressed for some other reason). |
| `null`     | We didn't propose a fix for that diagnostic.                            |

### 5.3 collateral

Inside a single window: how many *new* diagnostics did the fix
introduce? `max(0, regressed - resolved)`. Used to penalise rules whose
"fix" creates more bugs than it solves.

A rule with high effectiveness (`resolution - regression`) but high
collateral is doing more harm than it looks: each emit it resolves
also births a fresh diagnostic, just somewhere else.

### 5.4 adoption rate

For a rule_id over many windows: `adopted / total_outcomes` where
`adopted = COUNT(outcomes WHERE fix_applied = 'verbatim')`. "When this
rule fired and we proposed a fix, how often did the agent take it
verbatim".

A low adoption rate doesn't directly mean the rule is wrong — sometimes
agents prefer their own phrasing — but it strongly correlates with
"the fix doesn't actually do what it claims".

### 5.5 resolution / regression / effectiveness

| Metric           | Definition                                                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resolution rate  | `resolved / total_outcomes` per rule_id. "How often the diagnostic ends up fixed in the next call". |
| Regression rate  | `regressed / total_outcomes` per rule_id. "How often the same rule reappears as a NEW diagnostic in the next call". (Note: a regression is on the rule_id, not necessarily the same `fp`.) |
| Effectiveness    | `resolution_rate - regression_rate`. Goes from `-1` (every emit causes a regression) to `+1` (every emit ends in resolution). The headline rule-quality number. |

### 5.6 Labels

`src/core/analytics-labels.js` gates labels by sample size
(`LABEL_MIN_OUTCOMES = 5`) so a rule that fired once with a single
regression doesn't headline as `HARMFUL -100%`.

**Per-check labels (scorecard):**

| Label              | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`| `total_outcomes < 5`. We don't know yet.                              |
| `GOOD`             | `effectiveness > 0.5`.                                                |
| `OK`               | `0.15 < effectiveness ≤ 0.5`.                                         |
| `LOW`              | `0 ≤ effectiveness ≤ 0.15`.                                           |
| `HARMFUL`          | `effectiveness < 0`. The hint or fix is making things worse.         |

**Per-rule labels (rule-performance table):**

| Label              | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UNMATCHED`        | The rule_id is `<check>.unmatched` — i.e. we emitted the diagnostic with no matching rule. **Always wins** even at low samples; coverage gap is actionable. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`| Real rule, but `< 5` outcomes. Wait.                                  |
| `AT RISK`          | Real rule, ≥ 5 outcomes, `effectiveness < 0.15`. Look at it.          |
| `OK`               | Real rule, ≥ 5 outcomes, `effectiveness ≥ 0.15`. Healthy.             |

### 5.7 Active / disabled / probation / promoted / force-disabled

The state of a rule_id in the **rule registry** at a moment in time.
Defined in `engine.js`:

| State               | Set membership                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **active**          | In `_registry` and *not* in `_disabledRules`. Will run on the next emit. |
| **disabled**        | In `_disabledRules` — the case-base auto-disabled it because effectiveness is bad. Skipped on emit. |
| **force-enabled**   | In `_forceEnabled` (operator override). Runs even if `_disabledRules` lists it. |
| **force-disabled**  | In `_forceDisabled` (operator kill-switch). Never runs, no matter what analytics say. |
| **probation**       | A *promoted* rule's first 100 emits. If it crosses some quality bar in those 100, probation is resolved and it becomes a regular rule. Otherwise it gets demoted. |
| **promoted**        | Came from `.pos-supervisor/promoted-rules.json` rather than `src/core/rules/<Check>.js`. Hand-authored or operator-promoted from a case-base suggestion. |

Note the dashboard mixes "active rule" (the engine concept above) with
"active CSS class" (the UI concept of the currently-selected tab). On
the dashboard, "active" near a rule_id means the engine concept; near
a tab means the UI concept.

### 5.8 since / baseline

The dashboard's "Stats since" dropdown chooses a window:

- **Since baseline** — the operator's chosen "fresh start" timestamp,
  stored in `meta.analytics_baseline_ts`.
- **All time** — engine-state callers always read all time, regardless
  of the operator's baseline.
- **Last 24h / 7d / Custom** — the obvious thing.

Engine state (case-base auto-disable, probation resolution, CAC
predictor) deliberately does NOT respect the operator's baseline — a
narrow window can produce statistically meaningless decisions.
Reporting respects it. See the `resolveSince` contract in
`case-base.js`.

---

## 6. The adaptive engine

The adaptive engine is the closed loop: emits land in the analytics
database, the case base reads them back, and the engine adjusts its
behaviour for the next emit.

### 6.1 Engine modes

`src/core/engine-mode.js` defines two states stored in
`.pos-supervisor/engine-mode.json`:

- **static** — every rule fires at its raw confidence, no case-base
  scoring, no auto-disable, no promoted rules. Behaves like a classic
  static linter.
- **adaptive** — case-base scoring ON, auto-disable ON, promoted
  rules loaded ON.

Analytics collection happens in *both* modes — only consumption
changes. You can run static for a week, accumulate data, switch to
adaptive when the case base is dense enough to be useful.

### 6.2 Per-emit scoring

When a rule's `apply()` returns a result, `engine.js:applyCaseBaseScoring`
runs (only in adaptive mode):

```
scoreRule(store, rule_id, template_fp)
  → null       if < MIN_CASES (3) emits for this (rule, template)
  → null       if no outcomes recorded
  → { adjustment: number, reason: string }
```

The adjustment is bounded in `[-0.3, +0.3]` and shifts the rule's
emitted `confidence`. A rule with a 90% resolution rate on a specific
template gets a +0.2 boost; a rule with a 30% resolution rate gets a
−0.2 penalty. The `case_base_signal` field on the outgoing diagnostic
records the adjustment so the dashboard can show it.

### 6.3 Auto-disable

`case-base.js:ruleScores` runs periodically (`server.js:syncDisabledRules`).
Any rule with `effectiveness < 0.15` *and* `total_outcomes ≥ 10` is
added to `_disabledRules`. The threshold is intentionally
conservative: 10 outcomes is enough that the Beta posterior has
collapsed from "wide" to "informative", but not so high that bad rules
linger.

Auto-disable is *override-able* by the operator: the dashboard can
mark a rule `force_enable` (it runs even though analytics disabled it)
or `force_disable` (it never runs, even if a rule module re-registers
it). Both override sets are persisted in
`.pos-supervisor/rule-overrides.json`.

### 6.4 Promoted rules

`src/core/rules/promoted-rules.js` loads
`.pos-supervisor/promoted-rules.json` — declarative rules entered
through the dashboard's "Suggestion → Promote" flow. The flow is:

1. Case base finds a `template_fp` with consistent agent behaviour but
   no matching rule (`synthesizeGuardPredicate`).
2. The dashboard suggests "consider adding a rule for this pattern".
3. The operator reviews and clicks Promote, optionally tweaking the
   guard / hint.
4. The promoted rule lands in `promoted-rules.json` and becomes part
   of the registry on the next reload — running in **probation** for
   its first ~100 emits, then either auto-resolving (effectiveness
   ≥ 0.5 sustained) or auto-demoting.

The point of the probation stage is that a hand-authored rule is a
guess based on a case-base pattern that *might* generalise. We measure
it before trusting it.

### 6.5 CAC predictor

CAC = "case-based action classifier". It's a *fourth* gating axis on
top of severity / static confidence / adaptive-mode scoring.

For each surviving diagnostic post-pipeline, `applyCac`:

1. Computes an **empirical-Bayes adoption probability** using the
   hierarchical scorer in `scoreFixHelpfulness`:
   - try `(rule_id, file_domain)` — most specific
   - fall back to `rule_id`
   - fall back to `severity`
   - fall back to the prior (Beta(2,2) → 0.5)
2. Decides: `allow`, `downgrade` (severity by one step), or
   `suppress` — based on `config.threshold` and `config.action`.
3. Mutates the result in `active` mode; in `shadow` mode just records
   the decision.

The classifier is *always* safe — it can only suppress or downgrade,
never produce a new diagnostic, never alter a fix proposal. If the
predictor crashes, the result passes through unchanged.

CAC is opt-in. Default is disabled. Operators turn it on after enough
analytics accumulate to make the Bayes scorer informative.

### 6.6 The full feedback loop, illustrated

│   rule R': effectiveness -0.4, n=15 → added to _disabledRules │
│     → R' won't fire on the next emit until operator overrides │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Three timescales: per-emit scoring (`scoreRule`), per-batch
auto-disable (`ruleScores`), and ad-hoc promotion / probation. They
are all reading the same `outcomes` table, just at different
aggregation levels.

## 7. How an error becomes a hint, fix, and explanation — worked example

Take the case the agent hit in DEMO: `MissingPartial` for
`'lib/queries/contact_submissions/create'`. Trace it:

1. **LSP** fires `MissingPartial` with message
   `"'lib/queries/contact_submissions/create' does not exist"`.
2. **`normalizeLspDiagnostics`** turns the LSP shape into our internal
   diagnostic `{ check: 'MissingPartial', message: '…', line, column,
   _filePath }`.
3. **`enrichAll`** runs:
   - `extractParams('MissingPartial', message)` extracts
     `{ partial: 'lib/queries/contact_submissions/create' }`.
   - `templateOf` produces a fingerprintable template:
     `"'<PARTIAL>' does not exist"`.
   - `runRules(diag, facts)` walks rules in priority order:
     - `MissingPartial.invalid_lib_prefix` (priority 5) —
       `when(diag)` checks if the partial path starts with `lib/commands/`
       or `lib/queries/`. It does. Wins.
     - `apply(diag)` builds the hint: "Drop the invalid `lib/`
       prefix… Use `queries/contact_submissions/create` instead." A
       text_edit fix is generated that removes the `lib/` prefix from
       the source.
   - The diagnostic's `rule_id` becomes
     `MissingPartial.invalid_lib_prefix`, `confidence` is set to
     `0.95`, `fixes` includes the text_edit, `hint` is the markdown.
4. **Pipeline** runs:
   - `userSuppressions`: not configured. Pass.
   - `suppressLspKnownFalsePositives`: only matches
     `LiquidHTMLSyntaxError`. Pass.
   - …
   - `suppressByPending(MissingPartial)`: looks up the partial name
     against `buildPendingPartialNames(pendingFiles)`. The pending list
     contains `app/lib/queries/contact_submissions/create.liquid`,
     which expands to short-name `queries/contact_submissions/create`.
     The diagnostic's name is `lib/queries/...` — does NOT match. Pass
     (correctly).
   - `verifyMissingPartialsOnDisk`: tries
     `app/lib/lib/queries/contact_submissions/create.liquid` — does
     not exist. Confirms the LSP. Pass.
   - `populateDefaultConfidence`: rule already set rule_id and
     confidence, so this is a no-op.
5. **Fix generator** sees the rule already provided `fixes`, so it
   doesn't add anything else.
6. **CAC** (if enabled) looks up
   `(MissingPartial.invalid_lib_prefix, file_domain=pages)` history.
   Suppose 4 prior emits, 4 verbatim adoptions → high probability,
   `allow`.
7. **Response shape**:
   - `errors[0]` = the enriched diagnostic, with hint, suggestion,
     rule_id, confidence, fixes, hover_docs.
   - `must_fix_before_write` = true.
   - `next_step` tells the agent to apply the fix and re-validate.
8. **Emit log**: a `validator_emit` event is written with `fp`,
   `template_fp`, `rule_id`, `proposed_fixes` info; a `tool_call`
   event wraps the whole call.
9. **Next call** on the same file — agent has dropped the `lib/`
   prefix. Window classifier sees `fp_X` absent in the end set →
   `outcome = 'resolved'`, `fix_applied = 'verbatim'` (assuming the
   text edit was applied as proposed). Both go into `outcomes`.
10. **Aggregation**: case-base sees this rule's effectiveness inch
    up. Future emits of the same template_fp get a small confidence
    boost via `scoreRule`.

That same trace applies, with different rules selected at step 3, to
every diagnostic the system emits. The skeleton is uniform; only the
rule logic and the data files behind the hints change per check.

---

## 8. Where the gaps are right now

Reading from the report and the codebase together:

1. **Rule coverage on `PartialCallArguments`.** 49 of 80 emits are
   `.unmatched`. The rule module exists (5 priorities) but it covers
   `required_render` / `required_function` / `unknown_render` /
   `unknown_function` / a default — not the full surface of upstream
   messages. Adding a few targeted variants would shave that
   `.unmatched` count substantially.
2. **`MissingPage` resolution rate.** The bulk of the 25% number is
   the self-page false positive we just fixed. The next run should
   show this climbing toward `MissingPartial`'s level.
3. **`OrphanedPartial` resolution rate.** 50%. The pipeline already
   suppresses orphan flags on commands/queries; the surviving 50% are
   real partials that the agent doesn't always know how to wire. A
   concrete `OrphanedPartial.<reason>` rule with a "where could this
   be rendered from?" suggestion would help.
4. **`pos-supervisor:NonGetRenderingPage`** — the `get_form_target`
   variant has 1 emit / 100% regression in the report. It's a known
   pattern (form action pointing at a GET-only page) and the rule
   should produce a much more specific fix proposal.
5. **`UnusedAssign.generic`** — 12 emits, 83% resolved, but the
   suggestion is currently generic. A "if this is intentional, prefix
   with `_`" hint would close the rest.
6. **CAC adoption is at the prior** (`feature: prior, p_adopted: 0.5`)
   for most rules in the DEMO data. We need ~50+ outcomes per
   `(rule_id, domain)` before CAC has signal — keep collecting before
   flipping to `active`.
7. **Probation tracking is implemented but the dashboard's
   "Suggestion → Promote" flow is sparse** — case-base
   `synthesizeGuardPredicate` exists but the UI for reviewing
   suggestions could be tighter; that's where most of the new-rule
   throughput should come from once data accumulates.

The actionable work is at the rule layer, not the pipeline layer:
every `.unmatched` row in the rule-performance table is a missing rule
in `src/core/rules/<Check>.js`. Pick the rows with the highest
`Emitted` count and write rules for them.

---

## 9. Putting it all together

To restate the system in one paragraph:

The validator's *symbolic* core is `validate_code` walking a fixed
pipeline (parse → lint → enrich → suppress/verify → fix → respond),
backed by `src/core/rules/` for per-check logic and `src/data/` for the
domain knowledge those rules read. Its *neural* side is the analytics
loop: every emit is logged, the window classifier turns consecutive
calls into outcomes, the case base aggregates outcomes into per-rule
effectiveness, and the engine reads that back to score, disable, or
override rules on the next call. The dashboard is a window into the
analytics — labels like `GOOD`, `AT RISK`, `UNMATCHED` summarise the
case base's view of whether a rule is helping or hurting. CAC is a
fourth axis that uses the same analytics to predict whether the agent
will adopt the proposed fix at all, allowing the validator to suppress
diagnostics whose fix rarely lands.

The improvement levers, in order of ROI:

1. **Write rules for `<check>.unmatched` rows** with high emit counts.
2. **Tighten hints for `LOW` and `HARMFUL` checks** — those are
   actively misleading agents.
3. **Watch `regression_rate` over time** — a rule with a rising
   regression rate has a hidden bug in its fix proposal.
4. **Promote case-base suggestions** through the dashboard once
   `synthesizeGuardPredicate` surfaces them — this is the rule-
   authoring channel that scales without manual code review.
5. **Flip CAC to `active` only after** `(rule_id, domain)` history has
   ≥ 50 outcomes per cohort. Until then, CAC's prediction is the
   prior and adds nothing.

If you only remember three things from this document:

- **The pipeline is symbolic and ordered**; every step is a documented
  function and the order is load-bearing.
- **`<check>.unmatched` is the actionable signal**; every row tells you
  exactly which `src/core/rules/<Check>.js` needs a new rule.
- **Effectiveness is the only number that matters**, and it's gated by
  `LABEL_MIN_OUTCOMES = 5`. Anything `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` is just
  noise — wait for more data.
