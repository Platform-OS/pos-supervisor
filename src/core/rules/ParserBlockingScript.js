/**
 * ParserBlockingScript rule — `<script src="…">` tags without `defer` or
 * `async` block HTML parsing while the JS downloads.
 *
 * Pre-rule the check landed as `.unmatched` (no fix-generator heuristic, no
 * rule). We can't safely emit a `text_edit` from this layer — the rule
 * engine runs without file content, so building a valid `range` (which
 * needs to find the closing `>` of the opening `<script>` tag, possibly on
 * a wrapping line) isn't feasible without false positives.
 *
 * The rule attaches a stable `rule_id` and a structured guidance fix so
 * analytics get attribution and the agent gets a concrete decision tree
 * (`defer` vs `async` vs end-of-body). When fix-generator gains a
 * `fixParserBlockingScript` heuristic, the rule's `guidance` will be
 * dropped per the dedup precedence in validate-code.js.
