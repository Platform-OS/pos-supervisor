/**
 * UnusedDocParam rule — `@param X` declared in a `{% doc %}` block but
 * never referenced anywhere in the file body.
 *
 * Pre-rule the check landed as `.unmatched` (11 emits in DEMO, 60 %
 * resolve, 0 % regression). The pipeline's `suppressUnusedDocParams`
 * already handles the common false positive — params used only as named
 * args in `{% render %}` / `{% function %}` calls inside the same file.
 * Surviving emits are real cases where the declaration is dead inside
 * the body.
 *
 * Two valid resolutions, both contract-aware:
 *   • **Use** the param — reference \`{{ X }}\`, condition on it,
 *     forward to a render call, etc. Right when the declaration was
 *     intentional and the body just hasn't been written yet (mid-feature).
 *   • **Remove** the \`@param X\` line — turns the param into a no-op
 *     contract. CALLERS passing \`X: Y\` will then start hitting
 *     \`UnrecognizedRenderPartialArguments\`. Safe only when there are
 *     no callers (verify via \`platformos_references\`).
 *
 * No `text_edit`: removing a doc-block line is a contract change with
 * cross-file blast radius; the rule layer can't safely automate it.
 * The pipeline's `suppressUnusedDocParams` is the safe automation —
 * silencing the warning when the param is actually used outside the
 * body. This rule covers what survives: real dead declarations.
