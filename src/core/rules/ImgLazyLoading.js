/**
 * ImgLazyLoading rule — performance hint. The LSP flags an `<img>` without
 * `loading="lazy"`; this rule attaches the recommendation text and stable
 * attribution. The `text_edit` insert itself is produced by the heuristic
 * fix-generator in full mode — rules this trivial don't need to reimplement
 * position calculation.
 *
 * Plan reference: Tier 1 trivial wins.
