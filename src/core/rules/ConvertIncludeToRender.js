/**
 * ConvertIncludeToRender rule — migrate deprecated `{% include %}` to
 * `{% render %}`. The LSP reports the check on every non-module include; this
 * rule attaches the recommendation and stable attribution. A `text_edit`
 * replacement (`include` → `render`) is produced by the heuristic
 * fix-generator in full mode, with a guarded fallback for module-helper
 * includes where the rename is NOT safe.
 *
 * The module-helper guard lives in fix-generator.js (pattern: `include
 * 'modules/...'`). Keeping the skip logic there rather than duplicating it
 * here means one source of truth — this rule just makes sure every include
 * call gets a useful hint and a non-`unmatched` rule_id.
 *
 * Plan reference: Tier 1 trivial wins.
