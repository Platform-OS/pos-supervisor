/**
 * DuplicateFunctionArguments rule — pos-cli 6.0.7 duplicate-arg detection.
 *
 * Upstream fires for both `{% render %}` and `{% function %}` when the same
 * argument name appears twice in a single call. Liquid's last-key-wins
 * semantics silently drops the first value, so the bug is usually a typo
 * (two args meant to be different but typed the same). The rule attaches
 * a rule_id and an action-oriented hint; upstream supplies the autofix.
