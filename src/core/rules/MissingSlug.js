/**
 * pos-supervisor:MissingSlug rule — pages without a `slug:` in their front

 * fix-generator already produces an `insert` text_edit
 * (`fixMissingSlugInsert`) that prefills a sensible slug from the file
 * path. This rule promotes the check to a stable rule_id and ships a
 * `guidance` fix that explains *why* the slug matters — the heuristic's
 * literal text_edit remains the actionable diff.
