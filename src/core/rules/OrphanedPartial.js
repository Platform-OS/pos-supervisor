/**
 * OrphanedPartial rule — partial files that aren't rendered by anything
 * else in the project graph.
 *
 * Pre-rule the check landed as `.unmatched`. The diagnostic-pipeline already
 * suppresses commands/queries (invoked via `function`, not `render`) and
 * pending-plan files via `suppressOrphanedPartial` upstream of this rule, so
 * by the time we see one it's a real orphan in `app/views/partials/`.
 *
 * Two distinct intents → two recommendations:
 *   • The file is dead code → delete it (high-confidence delete_file fix when
 *     `referencedBy(file)` is empty in the graph).
 *   • The file is mid-development and the caller hasn't been written yet →
 *     pass `pending_files=[…callerPath]` to validate_code, or just write the
 *     caller now. The hint surfaces this option so agents don't blindly
 *     delete in-progress work.
 *
 * No fix when `diag.file` is missing — without the path we can't tell which
 * file to act on.
