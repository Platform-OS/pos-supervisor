/**
 * pos-supervisor:InvalidLayout rule — page front-matter references a layout
 * that doesn't exist on disk.
 *
 * Pre-rule the check landed as `.unmatched` even though fix-generator's
 * `fixStructuralCheck` already produced a `create_file` proposal. Pre-task-4
 * the proposal hardcoded the `.html.liquid` extension which DOES NOT match
 * many projects (DEMO included) — agents accepted the fix, the file landed
 * at the wrong path, and the original error never resolved.
 *
 * Task 4 fixed the path in the structural emitter (it now embeds the right
 * extension via `detectLayoutExtension`) and made `extractLayoutPath`
 * lift the path verbatim from the message. This rule attaches stable
 * attribution + a guidance fix that explains the two valid resolutions
 * (rename the layout reference vs create the missing layout file).
 *
 * Pairs with `ValidFrontmatter.layout_missing` (upstream LSP). The dedup
 * pass `suppressUpstreamFrontmatterDup` drops the upstream copy so only
 * this rule fires per offending page.
